## Concept

The idea behind this app is to allow users to generate recommendations for things to do based on their location. The app takes advantage of HTML5 geolocation, allowing the browser to ask the user if they want their location to be tracked. Giving this permission then allows the user to generate a list of 5 recommendations for the best things to do in the city that they are located in. The app uses OpenAI to generate these responses, so the list may differ each time you open the web app.
